# simple_calculator
This project is to create a simple calculator and then test code using Jasmine.

This simple calculator only allows you to use one mathematical operator ( +, -, * ,/ ) in one operation, and it doesn't recognize negative number. If there are any negative number or more than one mathematical operator in the operation, it will show error message "Operation not recognized".
